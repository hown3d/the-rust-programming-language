// data stored at that address that is owned by some other variable.
// Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type.
//
// references are immutable by default!

  // it refers to, nothing happens.

// to declare references to be mutable, we need to explicitly say that by prefixing "&mut".
// Mutable references have one big restriction:
// you can have only one mutable reference to a particular piece of data at a time.
